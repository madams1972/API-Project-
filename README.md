# API-Project-
API Project This project is collaborative work from a group of developers who created an application that solves a real-world problem--bad weather while camping. 
We divided up  our duties, and we shared our skills and knowledge with each other and leaned on our strengths.
Our group used everything weâ€™ve learned over the past six modules in Full-stack Developer Bootcamp to create a real-world front-end application that 
we will be able to use to showcase our work to others.
